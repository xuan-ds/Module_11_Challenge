### Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
1. Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site Links to an external site. The URL is https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html.
2. Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table. 
3. Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. 
4. Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column. 
5. Analyze the dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:
- How many months exist on Mars?
- How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
- What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? 
- Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? 
- About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? 

6. Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
